The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of commodity price trends and patterns across different cities and states in India during the years 2019 and 2020. By leveraging SQL, the analysis aims to identify critical insights such as the costliest commodities across years, price volatility, availability by variety, and regional disparities in pricing. This project is intended to assist policymakers, traders, supply chain managers, and market researchers in understanding market behavior, supporting price regulation decisions, and optimizing commodity distribution strategies.
